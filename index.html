    <h3 class="header-2">"INTO OBLIVION"</h3>
    <h4 class="header-3">A short story by Tim Shorts</h4>
    <p class="paragraph-1">“Pssst! wake up.” Exhausted, you slowly force your eyes to open to see Xan  looking toward the front of the boat, face filled with excitement. 
        “This must be it! The Shrine of Oblivion!” You glance over at the rest of the crew. Nothing seemed to be different with their mood. 
        The rhythmic sound of the four paddles churning through the water has not changed a bit. “You know I don’t like it when you get my hopes up Xan. 
        We have been searching for 8 months now with no luck. We don’t even know if it exists.” </p>
    <p class="paragraph-1">“This time is different!” He exclaims. “I can feel it.” The shadow of a cave begins to slowly swallow the boat until it is completely engulfed. 
        You begin to hear echoes of trickling water ripple through the cave as the light begins to fade. “Light the torches.” whispers the captain. 
        Just as the light dissipates, several torches are sequentially lit by passing the flame from one torch to another. The cave is just wide enough 
        that the torchlight barely reaches the walls. The sound of falling water is almost immediate now as the cave walls begin to narrow, almost 
        restricting access  by boat.</p>
    <p class="paragraph-1">“Is that a waterfall?” Someone asks. “It seems to be.” Says Xan. “and we are on the backside, so there must be something on the other side.” 
        A few crew members began to gasp in awe that seemed to flood the rest of the boat. You look over to see runic carvings on the walls glowing 
        in all sorts of colors and varying in shapes and symbols. “This is a good sign.” Says the captain. “We go through the waterfall. There shouldn't 
        be enough water to put out the torches.”</p>
    <p class="paragraph-1">Silence and anticipation fills the boat as the trickling water from the waterfall puddles at your feet. The light begins to dim as torches dim 
        from the water. The torches slowly work back their brilliance as we curve through the cave. Light from the cave ceiling leaking through several 
        cracks and gaps that overtake the torchlight. As we round another corner Xan shouts “There it is!” Excitement and an anxious fear floods into 
        your heart. Xan continues ”We found it! We found the Shrine of Obliv–” He is cut off as an unknown source crashes into the creaky wood of the 
        boat, sending it into the rocks. The momentum of hitting the rocks ejecting you and Xan along with most of your crew onto the cave grounds.</p>
